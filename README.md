# Encryption-Decryption

When starting the program, the necessary algorithm should be specified by an argument (-alg). Name the first algorithm as shift, the second one as unicode. If there is no -alg argument, default it to shift.

Remember that in case of shift, encode only English letters â€” from "a" to "z" and from "A" to "Z". In other words, after "z" comes "a", after "Z" comes "A".
